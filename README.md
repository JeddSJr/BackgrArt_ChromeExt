# Fixette - The arts loving browser extension
Made for my personal enjoyment Fixette is a simple chrome extension that overrides the new tab to display images of museum.
Currently it is only images from [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/) as it has a well-made [API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) and a world famous collection 

## Stack
Quick and simple as it doesn't necessitate (yet) anything complex
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

## Big Picture TO-DO
1. Make a Firefox port
2. Include more museums collections
3. Display informations about the images on the side to give knowledgeable insight
